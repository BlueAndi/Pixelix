/**
 * Fire simulation plugin.
 *
 * This basic one-dimensional 'fire' simulation works roughly as follows:
 * There's a underlying array of 'heat' cells, that model the temperature
 * at each point along the line.  Every cycle through the simulation,
 * four steps are performed:
 *
 * 1) All cells cool down a little bit, losing heat to the air
 * 2) The heat from each cell drifts 'up' and diffuses a little
 * 3) Sometimes randomly new 'sparks' of heat are added at the bottom
 * 4) The heat from each cell is rendered as a color into the leds array
 *
 * The heat-to-color mapping uses a black-body radiation approximation.
 *
 * It was ported from https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/blob/master/examples/Fire2012/Fire2012.ino
