# Differences to v1.5

* The clock crystal in v1.5 was removed, because it wasn't used.
* The I2S interface was added for digital microphones, like the INMP441.
* ESP32 Dev Kit C V4 will be used instead of ESP32 DEVKIT V1.
* It is also possible to use the Adafruit ESP32 Feather V2 instead of the ESP32 Dev Kit C V4.

# Input Only Pins
GPIOs 34 to 39 are input only pins. These pins don’t have internal pull-ups or pull-down resistors. They can’t be used as outputs, so use these pins only as inputs.

# Analog Pins
ADC2 is used by the Wi-Fi driver. Therefore the application can only use ADC2 when the Wi-Fi driver has not started.
See [Analog to Digital Converter](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-reference/peripherals/adc.html).

# JTAG

| Pin | Function |
| --- | --- |
| MTDI (GPIO 12) | Test Data Input |
| MTCK (GPIO 13) | Test Clock |
| MTMS (GPIO 14) | Test Mode Select |
| MTDO (GPIO 15) | Test Data Output |

See [ESP-PROG](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/debug-tools/esp-prog.html#debugging-tool-esp-prog).

# LED Matrix

The LED matrix consists of 8 x 32 WS2812B LEDs. Each LED has a max. current of 60 mA, which would result in a max. power consumption of 5 V / 15.36 A. The flexible LED panel matrix would be damaged with this high nominal power consumption, therefore it shall be limited to 5 V / 4 A.

Input voltage level:
* High - Min. 0.7 * VDD
  * => 0.7 * 5 V = 3.5 V
* Low - Max. 0.3 * VDD
  * => 0.3 * 5 V = 1.5 V

The i/o pins of the ESP32 are running with a 3.3 V level, which could cause a problem in detection a high!
Therefore the level must be shifted from 3.3 V to 5V.

# Ambient Light Sensor

The following table shows the output voltage, generated by a LDR like the GL5528 and a 1 k resistor. Both assembled as voltage divider.

| Ambient light | Ambient light | Photocell resistance | LDR + R | Voltage across R|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Moonlit night | 1 lux | 70 kΩ | 71 kΩ | 0.046 V |
| Dark room | 10 lux | 10 kΩ | 11 kΩ | 0.3 V |
| Dark overcast day / Bright room | 100 lux | 1.5 kΩ | 2.5 kΩ | 1.32 V |
| Overcast day | 1000 lux | 300 Ω | 1.3 kΩ | 2.538 V |
| Full daylight | 10,000 lux | 100 Ω | 1.1 kΩ | 3.0 V |
