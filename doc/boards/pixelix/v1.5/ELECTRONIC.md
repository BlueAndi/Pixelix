## Strapping Pins

The following table shows the strapping bit status on the ESP32 DevKitV1 board. See also ESP32 series datasheet chapter 2.4

| Pin | Default | Function 1 | Function 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Voltage of internal LDO (VDD_SDIO) |
| Pin | Default | 3.3 V | 1.8 V |
| GPIO 12 (MTDI) | Low | Low | High |
Result: 3.3 V

| Pin | Default | Function 1 | Function 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Booting mode |
| Pin | Default | SPI Boot | Download Boot |
| GPIO 0 | High | High | Low |
| GPIO 2 | Low | Don't care | 0 |
Result: SPI Boot

| Pin | Default | Function 1 | Function 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enabling/Disabling debugging log print over U0TXD during booting |
| Pin | Default | U0TXD Toggling | U0TXD Silent |
| GPIO 15 (MTDO) | High | High | Low |
Result: U0TXD Toggling

| Pin | Default | Function 1 | Function 2 | Function 3 | Function 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| GPIO 15 (MTDO) | High | Low | Low | High | High |
| GPIO 5 | High | Low | High | Low | High |
Result: Rising-edge Sampling

## Input Only Pins
GPIOs 34 to 39 are input only pins. These pins don’t have internal pull-ups or pull-down resistors. They can’t be used as outputs, so use these pins only as inputs.

## Analog Pins
ADC2 is used by the Wi-Fi driver. Therefore the application can only use ADC2 when the Wi-Fi driver has not started.
See [Analog to Digital Converter](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-reference/peripherals/adc.html).

## JTAG

| Pin | Function |
| --- | --- |
| MTDI (GPIO 12) | Test Data Input |
| MTCK (GPIO 13) | Test Clock |
| MTMS (GPIO 14) | Test Mode Select |
| MTDO (GPIO 15) | Test Data Output |

See [ESP-PROG](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/plus/debug-tools/esp-prog.html#debugging-tool-esp-prog).

# LED Matrix

The LED matrix consists of 8 x 32 WS2812B LEDs. Each LED has a max. current of 60 mA, which would result in a max. power consumption of 5 V / 15.36 A. The flexible LED panel matrix would be damaged with this high nominal power consumption, therefore it shall be limited to 5 V / 4 A.

Input voltage level:
* High - Min. 0.7 * VDD
  * => 0.7 * 5 V = 3.5 V
* Low - Max. 0.3 * VDD
  * => 0.3 * 5 V = 1.5 V

The i/o pins of the ESP32 are running with a 3.3 V level, which could cause a problem in detection a high!
Therefore the level must be shifted from 3.3 V to 5V.

# Ambient Light Sensor

The following table shows the output voltage, generated by a LDR like the GL5528 and a 1 k resistor. Both assembled as voltage divider.

| Ambient light | Ambient light | Photocell resistance | LDR + R | Voltage across R|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Moonlit night | 1 lux | 70 kΩ | 71 kΩ | 0.046 V |
| Dark room | 10 lux | 10 kΩ | 11 kΩ | 0.3 V |
| Dark overcast day / Bright room | 100 lux | 1.5 kΩ | 2.5 kΩ | 1.32 V |
| Overcast day | 1000 lux | 300 Ω | 1.3 kΩ | 2.538 V |
| Full daylight | 10,000 lux | 100 Ω | 1.1 kΩ | 3.0 V |
