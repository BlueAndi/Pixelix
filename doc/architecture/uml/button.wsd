    Design: The user button ISR counts the number of detected button triggers.
    The button task determines every 10 ms how many trigger are detected.
    If there are 0 triggers over 100 ms, the current user button state is valid.

:Install ISR on falling and rising edge.;

    :Increase trigger counter;
    
    note left: Runs in ISR.

                    The button queue will be handled in a
                    different task.
