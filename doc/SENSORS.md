# Sensors
Here is a list of supported sensors. Where they are connected, depends on the used [hardware board](BOARDS.md). Some of them need additional external parts e.g. the DHTx need a ext. 4.7kOhm pull-up resistor. Please check the corresponding datasheets.

* Ambient light sensor
  * Photoresistor GL5528
* Temperature and humidity sensors
  * DHT11 (Proprietary one-wire)
  * DHT12 (Proprietary one-wire)
  * DHT21 (Proprietary one-wire)
  * DHT22 (Proprietary one-wire)
  * SHT3x (I2C)
* Digital microphone
  * INMP441
